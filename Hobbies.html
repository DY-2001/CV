    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <ol>
      <li><h2><em>Coding</em></h2></li>
        <p>Code the Dream offers free intensive training in software development
           to people from diverse low-income backgrounds. In CTD Labs, our coders
           work with experienced mentors to hone those skills by building apps
           and technology platforms for a range of startups, nonprofits and
           government clients. The ultimate aim of Code the Dream is to create
           a unique win-win, where our coders gain real experience building apps
           that make the world a little better place, and then use that experience
           to launch new careers with enormous opportunity for themselves, their
           families, and their communities.<p>
      <li><h2><em>Typing</em></h2></li>
        <p>Dreaming that you are typing a book is an auspicious dream symbol.
           It means that you would soon get a monetary boost in reality. This
           financial gain may be from an inheritance of a large sum of money
           or property. It can also be a bonus or reward for your impressive
           work on a project. The progress on the book you are writing could
           give you a clue on when you are going to receive this reward. If
           you are almost done, then this means you may be getting your
           inheritance or bonus very soon.</p>
      <li><h2><em>Cricket</em></h2></li>
        <p>Whenever I think about my aim in life for exploring my willingness in
           sport, my mind is confused with a lot of options. My choice swung between
          two games Football and Cricket. Therefore, I thought on the choices deeply
          and decided that I really wanted to see myself as a cricketer.</p>
      <li><h2><em>Gaming</em></h2></li>
        <p>In her most recent paper, published in the latest issue of Dreaming,
          Gackenbach and her colleagues further solidified a key earlier finding:
          that so-called "hardcore" gamers were more likely than their peers to
          experience lucid dreams. Gackenbach first reached that conclusion in 2006,
          after noting that gamers and lucid dreamers both displayed traits like
          intense focus and superior spatial awareness in their waking lives. Indeed,
          when she surveyed 125 gamers and non-gamers on the frequency with which they
          experienced lucid dreams, Gackenbach found a strong association between the two.</p>
